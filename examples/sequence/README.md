# Using the sequence data type
This example demonstrates Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in KasperskyOS using a parameter of the
[sequence data type](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=ice_idl_data_types).
It implements a producer-consumer pattern where one application generates sequential data and
transmits it through a predefined static IPC channel. The receiving application logs each obtained
sequence to the standard error output.

For additional details on KasperskyOS, including its limitations and known issues, please refer to
the [KasperskyOS Community Edition Online Help](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=community_edition).

## Solution overview

### List of programs

* `Reader`—Program that receives sequence data through IPC channel and logs received sequences to
  standard error output.
* `Writer`—Program that generates sequential data patterns and sends them through IPC channel to the
  `Reader` program at regular intervals with error handling and size validation.
* `DCM`—System program that lets you dynamically create IPC channels.

### Initialization description

The solution initialization description file named `init.yaml` is generated during the solution
build process based on the [`./einit/src/init.yaml.in`](einit/src/init.yaml.in) template.
The macros in `@INIT_*@`‌ ‌format contained in the template are
automatically expanded in the resulting `init.yaml` file. For more details, refer to
[init.yaml.in template](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=cmake_yaml_templates).

### Security policy description

The [`./einit/src/security.psl`](einit/src/security.psl) file describes the security policy of the
solution. The declarations in the PSL file are provided with comments that explain the purpose of
these declarations. For more information about the `security.psl` file, see
[Describing a security policy for a KasperskyOS-based solution](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=ssp_descr).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Confirm that your host system meets all the
[System requirements](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=system_requirements)
listed in the KasperskyOS Community Edition Developer's Guide.
1. [Install](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=sdk_install_and_remove)
the KasperskyOS Community Edition SDK version 1.4. You can download it for free from
[os.kaspersky.com](https://os.kaspersky.com/development/).
1. Copy the source files of this example to your local project directory.
1. Set up the build environment by sourcing the SDK setup script in your terminal session:
   ```sh
   source /opt/KasperskyOS-Community-Edition-<platform>-<version>/common/set_env.sh
   ```
1. [Build the necessary drivers](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=building_radxa_drivers)
from source only if you intend to run this example on Radxa ROCK 3A hardware. This step is not
required for QEMU or Raspberry Pi 4 B.

### Building and running the example

The example is built using the CMake build system, which is provided in the KasperskyOS Community
Edition SDK.

#### QEMU

To build the example to run on QEMU, go to the directory with the example and run the following
commands:
```sh
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$KOSCEDIR/toolchain/share/toolchain-aarch64-kos.cmake"
$ cmake --build build --target {kos-qemu-image|sim}
```
where:

* `kos-qemu-image` creates a KasperskyOS-based solution image for QEMU that includes the example;
* `sim` creates a KasperskyOS-based solution image for QEMU that includes the example and runs it.

After a successful build, the `kos-qemu-image` solution image will be located at the `./build/einit`
directory.

#### Hardware

To build the example to run on the target hardware platform, go to the directory with the example and
run the following commands:
```sh
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$KOSCEDIR/toolchain/share/toolchain-aarch64-kos.cmake"
$ cmake --build build --target {kos-image|sd-image}
```
where:

* `kos-image` creates a KasperskyOS-based solution image that includes the example;
* `sd-image` creates a file system image for a bootable SD card.

After a successful build, the `kos-image` solution image will be located at the `./build/einit`
directory. The `hdd.img` bootable SD card image will be located at the `./build` directory.

To run the example on the target hardware platform:

1. Connect the SD card to the computer and copy the bootable SD card image to the SD card using the
  command:
   ```sh
   $ sudo dd bs=64k if=build/hdd.img of=/dev/sd[X] conv=fsync
   ```

   where `[X]` is the final character in the name of the SD card block device.

1. Connect the bootable SD card to the board.
1. Supply power to the board and wait for the example to run.

You can also use an alternative option to prepare and run the example:

1. Prepare the required hardware platform and a bootable SD card to run the example by following the
instructions:

   - [Raspberry Pi 4 B](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=preparing_sd_card_rpi).
   - [Radxa ROCK 3A](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=preparing_sd_card_radxa).
1. Run the example by following the instructions in the
[KasperskyOS Community Edition Online Help](https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-us&link=online_help&pid=kos&version=1.4&customization=KCE&helpid=running_sample_programs_rpi).

### Usage

[Build and run](#building-and-running-the-example) the example. After running the example, the
following actions will be executed:

1. The KasperskyOS kernel runs the `Einit` initialization process.
1. `Einit` initializes static IPC channels and runs all processes.
1. The `Reader` program will begin listening for sequence data on the IPC channel.
1. The `Writer` program will start generating and sending sequences every 3 seconds.
1. On successful completion of work, programs print messages to standard error output.
The expected output is contained in the [`./expected_output.txt`](expected_output.txt) file.
